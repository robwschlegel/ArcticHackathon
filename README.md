# ArcticHackathon
Source code for a [project](https://app.hackjunction.com/projects/hack-the-arctic/view/6038fe269f3b770044b01e7c) submitted to the [ #HackTheArctic Hackathon](https://hackthearctic.com/).

Bridging the gap between the Science produced by researchers and the general public is currently an important challenge and needs to be addressed. Here, we present a simple and clear [shiny app](https://robert-schlegel.shinyapps.io/svalbard/) to "Map the Science" currently undertaken around Svalbard, making it possible to interact with those data.

This project was awarded 2nd place during the competition.

**- analyses:** all the Python code used to process and analyse the data available on the App.

**- data_for_shiny:** link between the data produced in the analyses folder and the app in the shiny folder.

**- shiny:** all the R code for the creation of the shiny app.
